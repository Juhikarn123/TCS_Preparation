1 < Rank < 10^9

Input

The First line contains integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First-line contains integer N, denoting the number of employees.

The Second-line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the rank of each employee.

1 2
Output

7
3
Explanation

For test case 1, adhering to the rules mentioned above,

Employee - 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift

Employee - 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts

Employee - 3 whose rank is 1 gets one gift

Employee - 4 whose rank is 5 gets two gifts

Employee - 5 whose rank is 2 gets one gift

Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

Similarly, for testcase 2, adhering to rules mentioned above,

Employee - 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift

Employee - 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts

Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 = 3
